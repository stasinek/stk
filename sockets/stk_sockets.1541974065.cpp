//FTP RETURN CODES
/*

1xx     Positive Preliminary reply
The requested action is being initiated; expect another reply before proceeding with a new command. (The user-process sending another command before the completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding command is in progress.) This type of reply can be used to indicate that the command was accepted and the user-process may now pay attention to the data connections, for implementations where simultaneous monitoring is diffic
ult. The server-FTP process may send at most, one 1xx reply per command.

2xx     Positive Completion reply
The requested action has been successfully completed. A new request may be initiated.

3xx     Positive Intermediate reply
The command has been accepted, but the requested action is being held in abeyance, pending receipt of further information. The user should send another command specifying this information. This reply is used in command sequence groups.

4xx     Transient Negative Completion reply
The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place, but the error condition is temporary and the action may be requested again. The user should return to the beginning of the command sequence, if any. It is difficult to assign a meaning to "transient", particularly when two distinct sites (Server- and User-processes) have to agree on the interpretation. Each reply in the 4xx category might have a slightly different time value, but the intent is that the user-process is encouraged to t
ry again. A rule of thumb in determining if a reply fits into the 4xx or the 5xx (Permanent Negative) category is that replies are 4xx if the commands can be repeated without any change in command form or in properties of the User or Server (e.g., the command is spelled the same with the same arguments used; the user does not change his file access or user name; the server does not put up a new implementation.)

5xx     Permanent Negative Completion reply
The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place. The User-process is discouraged from repeating the exact request (in the same sequence). Even some "permanent" error conditions can be corrected, so the human user may want to direct his User-process to reinitiate the command sequence by direct action at some point in the future (e.g., after the spelling has been changed, or the user has altered his directory status.)

6xx     Protected reply
The RFC 2228 introduced the concept of protected replies to increase security over the FTP communications. The 6xx replies are Base64 encoded protected messages that serves as responses to secure commands. When properly decoded, these replies fall into the above categories.

The second digit is a grouping digit and encodes the following information:

Range   Purpose
x0x     Syntax
These replies refer to syntax errors, syntactically correct commands that don't fit any functional category, unimplemented or superfluous commands.

x1x     Information
These are replies to requests for information, such as status or help.

x2x     Connections
Replies referring to the control and data connections.

x3x     Authentication and accounting
Replies for the login process and accounting procedures.

x4x     Unspecified as of RFC 959.
x5x     File system
These replies indicate the status of the Server file system vis-a-vis the requested transfer or other file system action.

Below is a list of all known return codes that may be issued by an FTP server.

Code    Explanation
100 Series      The requested action is being initiated, expect another reply before proceeding with a new command.

220     Service ready for new user.
221     Service closing control connection.
225     data connection open; no transfer in progress.

229     Entering Extended passive Mode (|||port|).
230     User logged in, proceed. Logged out if appropriate.
231     User logged out; service terminated.
232     Logout command noted, will complete when transfer done.
250     Requested file action okay, completed.
257     "PATHNAME" created.

331     User name okay, need password.
332     Need account for login.
350     Requested file action pending further information
400 Series      The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place, but the error condition is temporary and the action may be requested again.
